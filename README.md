Customization

- Adding New Products: To add new products, simply add a new product card inside the `.product-list` in the `index.html` file with the appropriate `data-product` and `data-price` attributes.
  
  ```html
  <div class="product-card" data-product="New Product" data-price="500">
      <img src="assets/images/new.jpg" alt="New Product">
      <h3>New Product</h3>
      <p>$500</p>
      <button class="add-to-cart">Add to Cart</button>
  </div>
  ```

- Styling: You can modify the `assets/css/style.css` file to change the appearance of the shopping cart, including button styles, colors, and layout.

 Future Enhancements

- Discount codes: Allow users to apply discount codes to reduce the total price.
- Quantity adjustment: Add a feature to let users adjust the quantity of items directly from the cart.
- LocalStorage support: Save the cart’s state in the browser to retain items between sessions.
